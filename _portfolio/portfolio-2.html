title: "Motion Planning for Complex Manipulation Tasks"
excerpt: "Representing complex manipulation tasks, like scooping and pouring, as a sequence of constant screw motions in SE(3) allows us to extract the task-related constraints on the end-effector's motion from kinesthetic demonstrations and transfer them to newer instances of the same tasks. <br/>
This approach has been evaluated for complex manipulation tasks like scooping and pouring and also in the context of vertical containerised farming for transplanting and harvesting leafy crops. <br/>
We have also developed an approach that allows us to transfer the task-related constraints between objects which are functionally similar but have different geometries. The notion of functional similarity is captured by a knowledge base.<br/>

Using the screw-geometric structure of motion also allows us to generate motion plans for tasks which require object-environment contact like pivoting. <br/>
We have also developed a self-evaluation-based approach which allows the robot to compute the minimal set of kinesthetic demonstrations required to reliably perform tasks like pouring and scooping over a specified region of its workspace. <br/><img src='/images/Grasping.gif'>"
