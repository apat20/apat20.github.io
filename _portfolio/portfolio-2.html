title: "Motion Planning for Manipulation"
excerpt: "Through our work, we have shown that the screw-geometric representation of motion is a general way of representing motion plans in the task space which is a subset of SE(3).
This is representation can be used for tasks which involve contact with the environment as well as for complex manipulation tasks like scooping and pouring where it is difficult to specific the task constraints beforehand.
By representing motion plans associated with a task as a sequence of constant screw segments allows us to satisfy the task-related constraints without explicitly programming them. <br/>

Representing complex manipulation tasks, like scooping and pouring, as a sequence of constant screw motions in SE(3) allows us to extract the task-related constraints on the end-effector's motion from kinesthetic demonstrations and transfer them to newer instances of the same tasks.
This approach has been evaluated for complex manipulation tasks like scooping and pouring and also in the context of vertical containerised farming for transplanting and harvesting leafy crops.</br>

Representing complex manipulation tasks, like scooping and pouring, as a sequence of constant screw motions in SE(3) allows us to extract the task-related constraints on the end-effector's motion from kinesthetic demonstrations and transfer them to newer instances of the same tasks.
This approach has been evaluated for complex manipulation tasks like scooping and pouring and also in the context of vertical containerised farming for transplanting and harvesting leafy crops.
We have also developed an approach that allows us to transfer the task-related constraints between objects which are functionally similar but have different geometries. The notion of functional similarity is captured by a knowledge base.
Using the screw-geometric structure of motion also allows us to generate motion plans for tasks which require object-environment contact like pivoting.
We have also developed a self-evaluation-based approach which allows the robot to compute the minimal set of kinesthetic demonstrations required to reliably perform tasks like pouring and scooping over a specified region of its workspace. </br>
