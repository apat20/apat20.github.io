title: "Sensor-based Task Oriented Grasp Synthesis"
excerpt: "One of the key challenges in task-oriented grasp synthesis is to mathematically represent a task. In our work, we represent a task as a sequence of constant screw motions. Given a grasp (pair of antipodal contact locations) we can evaluate its feasibility for imparting the desired constant screw motion using our proposed task-dependent grasp metric. More recently, we have developed a neural network-based approach which solves the inverse problem, i.e. given an object representation in terms of a partial point cloud, obtained from an RGBD sensor, and a task in terms of a screw axis, compute a good grasping region for the robot to grasp the object and impart the desired constant screw motion.<br/>
