Education
======
* Ph.D in Mechanical Engineering - Robotics, minor in Computer Science, Stony Brook University 2025 (expected)
* M.S. in Mechanical Engineering, Stony Brook University, 2019
* B.E. in Mechanical Engineering, Savitribai Phule Pune University, 2012

Work experience
======
* Research Assistant
  * Associated with: [Interacting Robotic Systems Laboratory](https://sites.google.com/a/stonybrook.edu/robotics/), [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/)
  * Developed novel model-based and learning-based approaches for task-oriented grasp (regrasp) synthesis directly from sensor data while considering the motion to be imparted to the object.
  * Collaborated with graduate students and faculty in researching problems on utilizing the screw-
  geometric structure of motion for constrained manipulation, providing robots with self evaluation
  capabilities incremental acquisition of kinesthetic demonstrations, motion generalization, task planning and robot learning.
  * Developed novel motion planning, force planning, and trajectory optimization approaches incorporating environmental contact constraints.
  * Engineered a perception and manipulation stack using ROS in Python and C++, configuration integrating state-of-the-art deep learning-based approaches for object detection, segmentation, and scene
  understanding alongside novel screw geometry-based methods for path planning, grasping, and motion
  planning in an eye-in-hand setup.
  * Exploring the integration of foundation models—such as VLMs, LLMs, and transformer-based architectures—with screw geometry-based approaches to enhance a robot’s manipulation capabilities,
  particularly for tasks involving end-effector motion constraints.
  * Supervisors: [Dr. Nilanjan Chakraborty](https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/people/faculty/nilanjanchakraborty), [Dr. CR Ramakrishnan](https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/people/faculty/crramakrishnan) and [Dr. IV Ramakrishnan](https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/people/faculty/ivramakrishnan)

* Research Intern - Robotics and 3D Modelling (June 2024 -  August 2024)
  * Associated with: [Nokia Bell Labs](https://www.bell-labs.com/#gref), Murray Hill, NJ, USA 
  * Investigated techniques for representing and understanding large indoor physical spaces using radiance
  field techniques like NeRFs and 3D Gaussian Splatting to develop corresponding digital twins.
  * Developed efficient pipelines for generating 3D reconstructions of large indoor environments (warehouses) using data collected from fisheye cameras (Qoocam, Insta360, Kodak pixpro SP360), ceiling
  cameras (Axis), and RGB-D cameras (Intel Realsense D435i) mounted on a mobile robot.
  * Diagnosed and resolved key issues in camera calibration and data acquisition from RGB-D cameras
  on a moving mobile robot, leading to a **30%** improvement in PSNR during training for radiance field
  generation.
  * Supervisors: [Dr. Matthew Andrews](https://www.bell-labs.com/about/researcher-profiles/matthewandrews/) and [Dr.Jeongran Lee](https://www.bell-labs.com/about/researcher-profiles/jeongranlee/) ([Modelling and Opimization Group, AIRL](https://www.bell-labs.com/research-innovation/projects-and-initiatives/air-lab/modelling-optimization/#gref))
