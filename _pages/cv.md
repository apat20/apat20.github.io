Education
======
* Ph.D in Mechanical Engineering - Robotics, minor in Computer Science, Stony Brook University 2025 (expected)
* M.S. in Mechanical Engineering, Stony Brook University, 2019
* B.E. in Mechanical Engineering, Savitribai Phule Pune University, 2012

Work experience
======
* Research Intern - Robotics and 3D Modelling (June 2024 -  August 2024)
  * Associated with: Nokia Bell Labs, Murray Hill, NJ, USA 
  * Studied the problem of representing and understanding large indoor physical spaces using radiance field techniques (NeRFs and 3D Gaussian Splatting).
  * Developed pipelines for generating 3D representations of large indoor environments (warehouses) using data collected from fisheye cameras (Qoocam, Insta360, Kodak pixpro SP360), ceiling cameras (Axis), and RGB-D cameras (Intel Realsense D435i) mounted on a mobile robot. 
  * Supervisors: Dr. Matthew Andrews and Dr.Jeongran Lee (Modelling and Opimization Group, AIRL)

* Research Assistant
  * Associated with: Stony Brook University
  * Developed model-based and learning-based approaches for task-oriented grasp (regrasp) synthesis, directly from sensor data, while considering the motion to be imparted to the object after grasping.
  * Collaborated with graduate students and faculty in researching problems on utilizing the screw-geometric structure of motion for providing robots with self-evaluation capabilities, containerized vertical farming, motion generalization, mobile manipulation, robotic surgery and foundation models for robot learning.
  * Developed novel motion planning, force planning, and trajectory optimization approaches that incorporate environmental contact constraints.
  * Implemented a perception stack using ROS for an eye-in-hand configuration that preforms object detection, segmentation and point cloud extraction for task-based grasping and motion planning. 
  * Supervisors: Dr. Nilanjan Chakraborty, Dr. CR Ramakrishnan and Dr. IV Ramakrishnan

* Teaching Assistant
  * Associated with: Stony Brook University
  * MEC 310 - Introduction to Machine Design (Fall 2019)
  * MEC 410 - Design of Machine Elements (Spring 2020)
  * MEC 559 - Mobile Robotics and Autonomous Vehicles (Spring 2024)

* Graduate Assistant 
  * Associated with: Stony Brook University
  * Supervisor: Dr. Nilanjan Chakraborty 

Academic Projects
======
* Visual Odometry using Deep Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks
  * Implemented an end-to-end framework for Monocular Visual Odometry using Deep Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks trained on the KITTI Dataset

* Transforming Constraint Satisfaction Problems from MiniZinc to QUBO
  * Implemented a pipeline, in Python, for converting Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) modelled using MiniZinc into their equivalent Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulations.
  
* RRT Motion Planner for Differential Drive Robots
  * Implemented a modified RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Trees) using bidirectional search trees with node expansion heuristics and region-based sampling of the goal configuration 

Skills
======
* Programming Languages: Python, C++, MATLAB, Prolog 
* Frameworks: ROS, PyTorch, git, TensorFlow
* Application Software and CAD: PyBullet, SolidWorks, AutoCAD, Inkscape, Blender
* Libraries: Numpy, OpenCV, Open3D, nerfstudio, Eigen, scikit-learn, PCL, OpenGL
