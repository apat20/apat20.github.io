Education
======
* Ph.D in Mechanical Engineering (Robotics), Stony Brook University 2025 (expected)
* M.S. in Mechanical Engineering, Stony Brook University, 2019
* B.E. in Mechanical Engineering, Savitribai Phule Pune University, 2012

Work experience
======
* Research Intern - Robotics and 3D Modelling (June 2024 -  August 2024)
  * Nokia Bell Labs, Murray Hill, NJ, USA 
  * Studied the problem of representing and understanding large indoor physical spaces using different camera sensors.
  * Developed pipelines for generating 3D representations of environments using radiance field techniques (NeRFs, 3D Gaussian Splatting) for    data collected from fisheye cameras (Qoocam, Insta360, Kodak pixpro SP360), ceiling cameras, and RGB-D cameras (Intel Realsense D435i) mounted on a mobile robot for large indoor environments (warehouses etc.) 
  * Supervisors: Dr. Matthew Andrews and Dr.Jeongran Lee (Modelling and Opimization Group, AIRL)

* Research Assistant
  * Stony Brook University
  * Developed model-based and learning-based approaches for task-oriented grasp (regrasp) synthesis, directly from sensor data, while considering the motion to be imparted to the object after grasping.
  * Implemented a perception stack using ROS for an eye-in-hand configuration that preforms object detection, segmentation and point cloud extraction for task-based grasping and motion planning. 
  * Collaborated with graduate students and faculty in researching problems pertaining to utilizing the screw-geometric structure of motion for motion generalization, containerized vertical farming and providing robots with self evaluation capabilities.
  * Supervisors: Dr. Nilanjan Chakraborty and Dr. IV Ramakrishnan

* Teaching Assistant
  * Stony Brook University
  * MEC 310 - Introduction to Machine Design (Fall 2019)
  * MEC 410 - Design of Machine Elements (Spring 2020)
