I am a PhD student at the [Interacting Robotic Systems Laboratory](https://sites.google.com/a/stonybrook.edu/robotics/) at [Stony Brook University, New York](https://www.stonybrook.edu/) advised by [Dr. Nilanjan Chakraborty](https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/people/faculty/nilanjanchakraborty). My primary research interests are task-based grasp synthesis and motion planning for robotic manipulators. I envision a future where robots work alongside humans performing a repertoire of tasks other than just pick and place tasks. My research goal is to develop algorithms and technologies that would allow robots.

During the summer of 2024 I had the opportunity to intern at [Nokia Bell Labs](https://www.bell-labs.com/#gref) as part of the [Modelling and Optimization Group](https://www.bell-labs.com/research-innovation/projects-and-initiatives/air-lab/modelling-optimization/#gref) where I was mentored by [Dr. Jeongran Lee](https://www.bell-labs.com/about/researcher-profiles/jeongranlee/) and [Dr. Matthew Andrews](https://www.bell-labs.com/about/researcher-profiles/matthewandrews/). I worked on building 3D representations of indoor environments using radiance field techniques with the help of image sensors already existing in the environment.
