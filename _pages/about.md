I am a PhD student at the [Interacting Robotic Systems Laboratory](https://sites.google.com/a/stonybrook.edu/robotics/) at [Stony Brook University, New York](https://www.stonybrook.edu/) advised by [Dr. Nilanjan Chakraborty](https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/people/faculty/nilanjanchakraborty). My primary research interests are robotic manipulation, task-based grasp synthesis, and motion planning using realistic models of objects and environments available from modern-day sensors. I envision a future where robots work alongside humans, performing a repertoire of tasks beyond just pick and place operations. My research goal is to develop algorithms and technologies enabling robots to achieve this vision.

Throughout my PhD, I have worked on several projects aimed at advancing the state-of-the-art in robotic manipulation, motion planning, and grasp synthesis. I have also implemented solutions to real-world problems in healthcare (assistive robotics) and agriculture (containerized vertical farming using cobots). Currently, I am actively working on developing novel foundation models and deploying existing ones for robotic manipulation. Please visit the [Research](https://apat20.github.io/portfolio/) and [Publications](https://apat20.github.io/publications/) section for more information.

During the summer of 2024, I had the opportunity to intern at [Nokia Bell Labs](https://www.bell-labs.com/#gref) as part of the [Modelling and Optimization Group](https://www.bell-labs.com/research-innovation/projects-and-initiatives/air-lab/modelling-optimization/#gref) where I was mentored by [Dr. Jeongran Lee](https://www.bell-labs.com/about/researcher-profiles/jeongranlee/) and [Dr. Matthew Andrews](https://www.bell-labs.com/about/researcher-profiles/matthewandrews/). I worked on building 3D representations for dynamic digital twins of indoor environments using radiance field techniques with various image sensors. This valuable experience enhanced my skills in computer vision, deep learning, and data collection in real-world environments.
