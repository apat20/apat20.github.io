I am a PhD student at the Interacting Robotic Systems Laboratory at Stony Brook University, New York. My primary research interests are task-based grasp synthesis and motion planning for robotic manipulators. I envision a future where robots work alongside humans performing a repertoire of tasks other than just pick and place tasks. My research goal is to develop technologies that would allow robots to do the same and which would be useful not only for the end users but also for fellow researchers.

During the summer of 2024 I had the opportunity to intern at [Nokia Bell Labs](https://www.bell-labs.com/#gref) as part of the [Modelling and Optimization Group](https://www.bell-labs.com/research-innovation/projects-and-initiatives/air-lab/modelling-optimization/#gref). I worked on building 3D representations of indoor environments using radiance field techniques with the help of image sensors already existing in the environment. My mentors were Dr. Jeongran Lee and Dr. Matthew Andrews.
